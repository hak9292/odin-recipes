    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Taco seasoning mix along with salsa adds flavor to this simple chicken recipe. Recipe creator Faye says you can
        use any salsa you like: mild, medium, or hot, adding: "I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style
        canned corn. Very easy and quick!"</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>21 ounces zucchini, sliced</li>
        <li>2 onions, chopped</li>

        <li>3 cups water, divided</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Combine zucchini, onions, garlic, and 2 tablespoons water in a non-stick pan over medium heat; cook until zucchini are softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add remaining water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
