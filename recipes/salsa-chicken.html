    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Taco seasoning mix along with salsa adds flavor to this simple chicken recipe. Recipe creator Faye says you can
        use any salsa you like: mild, medium, or hot, adding: "I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style
        canned corn. Very easy and quick!"</p>
